 Today we're doing the readme for the I love drumming application . the website features curated content on each page  and the ability to make posts about drumming topics.  drumming topics are divided into three categories known as products performance and education . 



 on the homepage of the website I implemented a monthly feature called drummer of the month . this monthly feature sites  reasons why the chosen drummer is particularly deserving of the position,  recent audio recordings of the said person,  and links to their social media pages.  Scrolling down will allow you to see every single post made on the website . of course, you can see the title of the posting,  the user who had posted,  the category which it belongs to,  and the date/time it was made.



 the navigation bar is comprised of links that allow you to go to the education, performance, or products part of the website.  each section has an accompanying monthly feature and user posts for that category.  the curated content is a joy for me to create because I think it creates a level of Interest among the community and talking points those interested in posting .



 anybody is able to view the site but you must sign up in order to create posts . once you have signed up and signed in the profile link comes apparent on the navigation bar and you are able to see all the individual posts you have made on the website . The ability to edit or delete your posts is available on the profile page as well.



This project was built in Ruby on Rails. 

The gems Devise, CarrierWave, MiniMagick, Fog and  CKeditor made this project much more efficient!



Devise provides user authentication and the ability to sign in and sign out.

CKeditor gives the user a whole interface to type and stylize their post with custom fonts, sizes, and the ability to embed HTML.

CarrierWave lets us upload files, MiniMagick lets us resize the image, and Fog allows the file to go  Amazon Web Services. 



The whole page was stylized in CSS and Materialize!
