# About iLoveDrumming

This project was built in Ruby on Rails. 

The gems Devise, CarrierWave, MiniMagick, Fog(for Amazon Web Service storage configuation) and CKeditor made this project much more efficient!

Devise provides user authentication and the ability to sign in and sign out.

CKeditor gives the user a whole interface to type and stylize their post with custom fonts, sizes, and the ability to embed HTML.

CarrierWave lets us upload files, MiniMagick lets us resize the image, and Fog allows the file to go Amazon Web Services. 



The whole page was stylized in CSS and Materialize!

# More about the website!

The main purpose of iLoveDrumming was to unite the drum community in a meaningful and fun way. I created a forum for discussion that is focused on drum related topics. Those topics are performances, education and products. I also implemented written content about each of those aforementioned categories.

The navigation bar is comprised of links that allow you to go to the education, performance, or products part of the website. Each category has an accompanying article and subsequent user posts. The curated content is a joy for me to create because it creates interest and talking points for those interested in discussion. I hope users will contribute meaningful content as well. In order to bring this hope to life, I implemented an image upload option in the text editor. Drummers can now upload relevant sheet music and notation for consumption!

On the homepage of the website I implemented a monthly feature called Drummer Of The Month. This monthly feature cites reasons why the chosen drummer is particularly deserving of the position, recent audio recordings of the chosen person performing, and links to their social media pages. Scrolling down further on the homepage will allow you to see every single post made on the website. You can see the title of the posting, the user who had posted, the category which it belongs to, and the date/time it was made.

Anybody is able to view the site but you must sign up in order to create posts. Once you have signed up and signed in the profile link appears on the navigation bar. The profile page holds all the individual posts you have made on the website. The ability to edit or delete your posts is available on the profile page as well.

Thank you for reading this and I hope you have fun using iLoveDrumming! More updates coming soon!
